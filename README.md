It looks so better when you have a mentor like #vimaldaga sir which gives you the knowledge which sometimes also not available to google. Under the mentor-ship of #vimaldaga sir I have completed one of the amazing technology known as docker and along with it I also learned how to think like a creator. A huge thanks goes to #vimaldaga sir for providing this much useful knowledge to us.
Lets me give you some brief knowledge about what docker is :- 

This is a great tool to launch almost any operating system within a 1 second like:- ubuntu, centos etc. This tool is used in deployment phase of software development. This tool is used when we want that any project that we built in our system also run on other system irrespective of the Operating system then we create on docker container and make project on the top of it then this project will run on all the system. 

After learning this new technology I have made one of the great project of my life which is Online-Compiler which basically use a docker container to run code written in programming language ( Currently java, python and c are supported ) and then displays the output to the user. As soon as a client access the online compiler services a new docker container launch at that time so that client can run their program and when client exit the services automatically that container will be removed. 

Frontend:- Flask
Backend:- Python integration with linux 
Technology:- Docker
